Findings summary:

Upon reviewing the results and analysing the data, the player colluding to scam Lucky Duck is Mylie Schmidt.
Mylie Schmidt played a total of 13 times over 03/10, 03/12 and 03/15
To expand upon this, Lucky Duck encountered losses across these days at these times:

10th March:
05:00:00 AM
08:00:00 AM
02:00:00 PM
08:00:00 PM
11:00:00 PM

12th March:
05:00:00 AM
08:00:00 AM
02:00:00 PM
08:00:00 PM
11:00:00 PM

15th March:
05:00:00 AM
08:00:00 AM
02:00:00 PM

In addition to this, I discpvered one dealer who was also working during these periods, which leads me to believe they were also colluding to scam Lucky Duck.
This was in fact Billy Jones, who worked during all these loss periods, totaling 13 times, same as Mylie Schmidt.
Below are the shift times of Billy Jones over the mentioned 3 days when losses occured:

10th March:
05:00:00 AM Billy Jones
08:00:00 AM Billy Jones
02:00:00 PM Billy Jones
08:00:00 PM Billy Jones
11:00:00 PM Billy Jones

12th March:
05:00:00 AM Billy Jones
08:00:00 AM Billy Jones
02:00:00 PM Billy Jones
08:00:00 PM Billy Jones
11:00:00 PM Billy Jones

15th March:
05:00:00 AM Billy Jones
08:00:00 AM Billy Jones
02:00:00 PM Billy Jones

Upon referencing both Mylie Schmidt's playing times and Billy Jone's shift times it is clear that both involved with the scams and losses which occured at Lucky Duck. Every loss accounted for across 10th, 12th of 15th of March all involved these two parties.
