Hello Bailey, Congratulations on an outstanding homework assignment! You were able to demonstrate your data analysis skills in this casino-based assignment! You’ve done a great job analyzing and correlating the evidence. 
You’ve created three notes files that accurately identify the player, Mylie Schmidt, and dealer, Billy Jones, present at each loss. 
You’ve identified the dates and times of the losses and you’ve provided an explanation of your findings which identifies Billy and Mylie as the player and dealer responsible for the casino’s losses. 
You’ve also provided a script that identifies the roulette dealer working at a specified date and time. You’ve done a great job on this script. 
You also completed the bonus script by identifying the dealer working a specified game at a specified date and time. You’ve done a great job with your analysis of the data and documenting your findings! 
Keep up the good work.
